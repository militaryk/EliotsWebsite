	<article><h1>What is Town of Salem?</h1>
	<p>Town of Salem is a social deduction game, where the town (good guys) have to find out who the mafia (bad guys) are. At the beginning of each game, you will be assigned a random role. Each role has a special ability, for example: The doctor can chose to save somebody each night.</p>
	</article>
	<article><p>There are two phases the game can be in: Day and night. During the day time, everyone can discuss what happened in the last night, and raise their suspicions to the rest of the town. After a certain amount of time, the down finish of the day by voting to lynch someone. If you are in the town, you want to vote to lynch anybody that you or the town have suspicions of being mafia. Once voted up, the voted person may provide a defence, proving their innocence or (more likely) proving the town's suspicion. The town then finally decides whether this person is innocent or guilty, and if the majority voted guilty, the player will be lynched, and their role revealed to the town. Below is a picture of what lynching a player looks like (I have censored names).

	<article><p> During the night phase, people can preform their abilities. The Mafioso and Godfather (both mafia roles) decide to murder somebody that night, while the doctor saves somebody (this only works if the doctor saved the person who was murdered that night.) Other roles such as the sheriff (checks if a player is innocent or guilty) can use their abilities to help out town members. Below is a list of role categories, with examples of what they could do (an image is provided to show how many of each are in a game.)</p>
<div id=centerimage><img src="images/tosroles.jpg" class="rightimage" alt="Town of Salem Roles"/></div>
	<ul>
		<li><green>Jailor</green> (only role in it's category. Can imprison someone each night, and ask them to provide evedince of their innocence. If the Jailor is mistrusting of the player's evidence, they have the option to execute the jailed player (a jailor can only execute 3 people per game.) Players can not prefrom their action while in jail)</li>
		<li><green>Town</green><blue> Investigative</blue> (eg: Sheriff checks if a player is guilty; Investigetor invests a player, and is provided with a list of three roles that this player <i>could</i> be.)</li>
		<li><green>Town</green> <blue>Protective</blue> (eg: Doctor saves someone each night, if that person was attacked, they will be healed; Bodyguard is the same, but if they succesfully save their target, they will take the bullet instead, and die)</li>
		<li><green>Town</green> <blue>Killing</blue> (eg: Vigilante has 3 bullets throughout the game, and can use them to shoot any suspicious players. A vigilante dies of guilt if they shoot an innocent player; Veteran gan go on alert 3 times throughout the game. If any player (including town) visits the Veteran while on alert, they will be shot by the veteran. If the Veteran kills an innocent, there is no punishment.)</li>
		<li><green>Town</green> <blue>Support</blue> (Towm Support has the most possible roles. Eg: Medium can speak to the dead during night; Retrebutionist can bring one person back from the dead per game.)</li>
		<li><blue>Random</blue> <green>Town</green> (This can be any town membeer mentioned above.)</li>
		<li><red>Godfather</red> (Commands the Mafioso to kill someone each night. The Godfather appears innocent to Town Investigative roles.)</li>
		<li><red>Mafioso</red> (Is commanded to kill someone each night by the Godfather. If the Godfather dies, the Mafioso will become the new Godfather.)</li>
		<li><blue>Random</blue> <red>Mafia</red> (eg: Blacmailer can prevent any other player from talking during the day; Framer can make an innocent person appear guilty to the Town Investigative roles.)</li>
		<li><grey>Neutral</grey> <blue>Evil</blue> (Has a specific objective aside from Town and Mafia. Eg: Jester wins if they are lynched by the town; Executioner starts the game with a target. They need to have their target lynched by the end of the game)</li>
		<li><grey>Neutral</grey> <blue>Killing</blue> (Wants all other players (including mafia) dead. Eg: Werewolf kills someone every night there is a full moon (a full moon occurs every second night.) The werewolf also has a similar affect as an alert Veteran on full moon nights; Arsonists can choose to douse someone in oil every night. The arsonist has the option every night to ignite. This kills all doused players.)</li>
	</ul>
		
	<article><p>Note: There are plenty more than 2 roles under each category, those are just examples. Not every role will be seen every game (except for Jailor, Godfather and Mafioso.)</p>
	</article>
	<article><h2>How can I get better at Town of Salem?</h2>
		<p>One important thing is to always keep a will. A will is used to show what you do each night. If you are killed, everyone will be able to see your will. A will can also be used to prove your innocence, so keep a fake will if you are Mafia/Neutral.</p>
		<p>Once you have played long enough, you should start to have a strategy for each role. This (in my opinion) can only happen if you continue to play the game.</p>
		<p>I like to play this game because I like social deception games. I find it fun to try and figure out who the bad guys are (or if I am the bad guy, to deceive the town.)
